Replication materials for 2019 ISQ article. 

Running the do file locally should be able to replicate all the results in the article but you can also find the Stata database on this repository. You will need Stata 15 to replicate the results. If you need the data in a different format feel free to email me. 

Note that the results in the manuscripts are rounded up. Other than that, the results should be the same. If you find that they are not or have any questions do let me know!
